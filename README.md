# 🚀 IAM-Driven Access Control Tool for Multi-Team Cloud Infrastructure

Welcome to this fun and evolving project where we aim to make AWS IAM access control simpler, smarter, and more secure—powered entirely through the **AWS CLI**. This is designed for real-world team collaboration involving **Developers**, **QA**, **DevOps**, and more.

> 🔐 Whether you're building for a single team or a full organization, managing IAM via CLI gives you speed, consistency, and full automation power.

---
## 🧰 Prerequisites
Before running the tool, make sure you have the following installed:

#### ✅ System Requirements

*   **Python 3.7+**
    
*   **AWS CLI** installed and configured
    
*   **IAM credentials** with permissions to simulate and create IAM resources
    

## 🔧 Installation Steps

```
1. Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourname/iam-access-control-project
    cd iam-access-control-project

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install required Python packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure AWS CLI (if not already done)
    aws configure
```

## ▶️ Running the Tool

Once setup is done, simply run:
```
python main.py

```

You'll be presented with an interactive CLI to:

*   ✅ Create IAM users, groups, and roles
    
*   🛡️ Build and validate custom IAM policies
    
*   📊 Simulate access with AWS CLI's IAM simulation
    
*   💾 Save policies to JSON
    
*   📁 Log and export actions for audit/debugging

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

This project is just the beginning. I’m learning and growing every day — and this tool will evolve with time. Here's what's coming or what I’d love help with:

- 🌐 **Frontend Web UI** (React/Next.js preferred)
- 🧪 **Unit Tests** for each module
- 📊 **Report Generator** for simulation results
- 📁 **Upload/Import JSON policies** from files
- 🔍 **Searchable CLI menu** for ease of use
- 🧑‍💼 **User-based dashboards** (IAM user activity reports)
- 🚀 **Dockerize the project** for easy deployment
- ☁️ **Optional Terraform integration** for infra-as-code automation

> 🙌 I'm learning — this is not a perfect tool, but a fun, practical project that reflects real-world AWS IAM use cases. Your feedback and ideas are more than welcome.
